# Changelog

Notable user-facing changes for NVIDIA Config Manager should be recorded here.

This project uses release tags for published versions. Add entries under
`Unreleased` while changes are in flight, then finalize them under the release
version before the selected release candidate is promoted.

## Unreleased

- No unreleased changes have been recorded yet.

## 1.3.2

### Fixed

- Fixed air-gapped template-plugin installation by installing bundled wheels
  without contacting PyPI.

## 1.3.1

### Added

- Added a DHCP lease API and dashboard with searchable, paginated views of
  leases, reservations, pools, and subnet data.
- Added site configuration backup and live configuration-diff workflows,
  including bulk device selection, child-workflow result reporting, and
  workflow action auditing.
- Added YAML-driven Nautobot group-to-role mappings for JWT-authenticated users
  and gated integration coverage for the RBAC configuration.
- Added OpenTelemetry tracing and metrics across services and Temporal
  workflows, plus optional NATS exporter monitoring for Nautobot messaging.
- Added support for kgateway, external Temporal deployments, image digests,
  Ceph-backed ZTP storage, and installer-managed Vault/OpenBao and PVC content.

### Changed

- Improved workflow and device UI filtering, sorting, site context, forms,
  status details, accessibility, and error presentation.
- Expanded the Spectrum-X AIR topology, templates, examples, and end-to-end
  switch-management documentation.
- Improved installer behavior for local images, secrets, storage staging,
  deployment updates, and Python 3.13 environments.

### Fixed

- Fixed a Nautobot uWSGI self-deadlock on `/metrics/` by running
  `prometheus_client` in multiprocess mode, and scrape Nautobot via `/metrics/`
  instead of `/metrics` to avoid recurring 404s. Nautobot metrics now aggregate
  across all uWSGI workers instead of reporting only the worker that answered
  the scrape. The multiprocess metrics directory is an `emptyDir` with a size
  limit so it starts empty on every pod start and cannot grow without bound,
  and the Celery probes no longer leave metric files behind on each check.
- Fixed multi-deploy result duplication, backup persistence reporting,
  intended-configuration validation, workflow locking, and several workflow
  replay and child-workflow edge cases.
- Fixed ZTP streaming and storage handling, including download hardening and an
  ONIE provisioning race condition.
- Fixed authentication and authorization edge cases involving JWKS caching,
  SPIFFE path matching, in-cluster Nautobot requests, and Temporal codec CORS.
- Fixed Helm deployment issues involving Temporal image credentials, Redis
  update strategy, monitoring namespaces, and Nautobot readiness checks.

### Security

- Added CodeQL and secret scanning, a secret-free build stage for untrusted pull
  requests, and repository guidance and hooks for cryptographically signed
  commits.
- Hardened installer archive extraction, ZTP download streaming, shell tooling,
  and container images, and updated vulnerable application and UI dependencies.

## 1.3.0

### Added

- Added an MCP server for NVIDIA Config Manager, including workflow tools,
  standard OAuth discovery endpoints, and a Microsoft Entra ID compatibility
  proxy for native MCP clients.
- Added an installer-driven NVIDIA AIR simulation workflow with interactive and
  headless operation, topology setup, image selection, launch progress, and
  troubleshooting documentation.
- Added InfiniBand PKey creation and membership workflows and a port GUID
  discovery workflow, with UI forms, UFM integration, GUID normalization, drift
  handling, and user guides.
- Added SpX Overlay creation, assignment, deletion, and tenant-change workflows
  with UI forms, VRF-to-VXLAN associations, namespace-aware behavior,
  route-distinguisher allocation, and user guides.
- Added generated Go clients for the config-store, DHCP, render, Temporal, and
  ZTP APIs, with generation and contract-drift checks in CI.
- Added an optional local observability stack with Prometheus, Alloy,
  PodMonitors, probes, alerting rules, and an NVIDIA Config Manager dashboard.
- Added Nautobot bootstrap support for custom fields, including NICo interface
  identifiers and related status metadata.

### Changed

- Refactored the workflow UI with server-side filtering, pagination, clearer
  labels and authentication errors, and updated workflow forms.
- Expanded the UI authentication controls with a logout option and clearer
  unauthorized-user states.
- Expanded the SuperPOD and AIR example topologies, Cumulus Linux 5.16.1
  templates, and UFM development fixtures.
- Published the documentation site from the public repository and expanded the
  installation, API, authentication, observability, MCP, workflow, and AIR
  simulation guides.
- Improved air-gapped packaging and registry upload support, including
  architecture-specific bundles and bundled dependency metadata.

### Fixed

- Fixed workflow replay and state handling, including nullable fields, newly
  added search attributes, and preservation of pending tenant-deploy state.
- Fixed Helm deployment edge cases involving shared GatewayClasses, monitoring
  namespaces and ports, DHCP liveness checks, OIDC secrets, and cluster-local
  Temporal service names.
- Fixed authentication handling for Temporal codec endpoints.

### Security

- Updated application dependencies, Go tooling, Stork, and distroless runtime
  images to incorporate current security fixes.
- Hardened CI pipelines and improved static-analysis accuracy and coverage.

## 1.2.3

### Security

- Fixed a regression in default authentication behavior introduced when consolidating
  service authentication into the shared mono-repo auth library. When SSO is enabled,
  service endpoints now require authentication by default, with health checks and
  metrics as explicit unauthenticated exceptions.
- Added Envoy header removal for spoofable identity headers, including
  `ssl-client-cert` and `X-Auth-*` headers, so legacy mTLS auth paths cannot be
  reached by forging client-supplied headers.

## 1.2.2

- Official OSS release.
